## Architecture

The VPP Agent is basically a set of VPP-specific plugins that use the 
CN-Infra framework to interact with other services/microservices in the
cloud (e.g. a KV data store, messaging, log warehouse, etc.). The VPP Agent
exposes VPP functionality to client apps via a higher-level model-driven 
API. Clients that consume this API may be either external (connecting to 
the VPP Agent via REST, gRPC API, Etcd or message bus transport), or local
Apps and/or Extension plugins running on the same CN-Infra framework in the 
same Linux process. 

The VNF Agent architecture is shown in the following figure:

Each (northbound) VPP API - L2, L3, ACL, ... - is implemented by a specific
VNF Agent plugin, which translates northbound API calls/operations into 
(southbound) low level VPP Binary API calls. Northbound APIs are defined 
using [protobufs][3], which allow for the same functionality to be accessible
over multiple transport protocols (HTTP, gRPC, Etcd, ...). Plugins use the 
[GoVPP library][4] to interact with the VPP.

The following figure shows the VPP Agent in context of a cloud-native VNF, 
where the VNF's data plane is implemented using VPP/DPDK and 
its management/control planes are implemented using the VNF agent:
